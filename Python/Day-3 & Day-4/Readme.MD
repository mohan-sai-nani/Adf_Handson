## Query: let’s re-write the code again that we worked last week cleaning-up using OOPS concepts –
1.	Reading and writing file should be in Parent class
2.	Inherit a class for operations to print the details.
3.	Define methods for each operations in separate method.
4.	Define common method for printing that can be used from other methods.
5.	Define constructor for initializing the self-variables.
6.	Create Config File to store standard configs.
7.	Include logging in the code
8.	Also follow the PEP-8 guidelines in developing the code.
